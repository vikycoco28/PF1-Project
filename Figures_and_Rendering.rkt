; a Tool is a structure (make-tool type size color mode x1 y1 x2 y2 status)
; where   type : String
;         size : Number
;        color : Color    ; (in 2htdp/image there's already a struct for color, we could use that)
;         mode : String or Number
;                represents the mode for the figures ("outline", "solid", ...)        
;                (it can also be a number from 0 to 255 that indicates its transparency, with 0 being fully transparent and 255 being "solid")
;       x1, y1 : Number
;                represents the coordinate of the starting point of the current figure/tool
;       x2, y2 : Number
;                represents the coordinate of the ending point of the current figure/tool
(define-struct tool [type size color mode x1 y1 x2 y2]) 

; a List<Image> is on of:
; - '()

; an AppState is a structure (make-appstate canvas pre post tool quit)

;         post : List<Image>
;         tool : Tool
