; a Tool is a structure (make-tool type size color mode x1 y1 x2 y2 status)
; where type : String
;       size : Number
;       color : Color ;(in 2htdp/image there's already a struct for color, we could use that)
;       mode : String or Number
;              represents the mode for the figures ("outline", "solid", ...)        
;              (it can also be a number from 0 to 255 that indicates its transparency, with 0 being fully transparent and 255 being "solid")
;       x1, y1, x2, y2 : Number
;                        represent the coordinates of the current figure/tool
(define-struct tool [type size color mode x1 y1 x2 y2])

; a List<Image> is one of:
; - '()
; - (cons Image List<Image>)
; interpretation: a list of canvases

; an AppState is a structure (make-appstate canvas pre post tool quit)
; where canvas : Image
;       pre, post : List<Image>
;       tool : Tool
;       quit : Boolean
; interpretation: it represents the current state of the app
(define-struct appstate [canvas pre post tool quit])
